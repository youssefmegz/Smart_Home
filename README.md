# Smart Home Automation Project

## Project Title:
**Smart Home Automation Using ATmega32, LCD, Temperature Sensor, LDR Sensor, Flame Sensor, and Motor Control**

## Overview:
This project implements a smart home automation system using the **ATmega32** microcontroller. It automates lighting and fan speed control based on environmental conditions (light and temperature). Additionally, it includes fire detection and displays real-time system status on an LCD.

### Features:
1. **Automatic Lighting Control**: The system adjusts the light levels using an LDR and controls three LEDs based on ambient light intensity.
2. **Fan Speed Control**: Adjusts fan speed using a PWM signal in response to temperature readings from the LM35 sensor.
3. **Fire Detection and Alert**: A flame sensor detects fire, triggers an alarm, and displays an alert on the LCD.
4. **LCD Display**: Shows real-time system feedback, including temperature, light intensity, fan status, and fire alerts.
